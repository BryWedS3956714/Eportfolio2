      Hi, my name is Bryan Wedding. I was born in Queensland in the Town of Ipswich. <br>
      Fun Fact: The hospital I was delivered in was on an Australian Air Force Base in Amberley, Queensland â€” This would come as no surprise to anyone that has met my family, as I was raised by multiple family members that served in the Australian Armed Forces. <br><br>
      Presently, I live in the Barossa Valley in Adelaide, South Australia. Before this, I travelled the Eyre Peninsula working as a Banker for ANZ (Australian New Zealand Banking Group). At that time, I moved house every six months and it was intense yet extremely exciting. <br><br>
      I am a beginner in Studying IT (Information and Technology) (Information and Technology) at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) University and a student of Commerce at Curtin University. <br>
      I currently work in the Banking Industry for Westpac as a Mortgage Quality Analyst. One of my career highlights is that I have previously worked as a 000 Telephone Operator as a First Responder for eight months which has been one of the most interesting experiences of my life.<br><br>
      I would consider myself as someone who has a deep passion for learning. I find myself frequently going down rabbit holes of information every week.<br> Because of this, I have developed numerous hobbies and interests. Some of my favourite hobbies include Golf, Linguistics, Gaming, Anime, History, and American Football <strong>(Go Ravens!).</strong>
