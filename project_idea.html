      Scramble is a program that acts as an employee candidate passport. The program is designed to be a centralised compilation of a candidate’s requirements ranging from the candidate’s aptitude markings, personality test results, and comprehensive identification. Scramble caters to both employee candidates and employers due to its AI (Artificial intelligence) matching filter that assists in the hiring process.<br><br>
      The fundamental idea of this software is for it to assist and empower both ends of the hiring process. The development of this software will allow a more streamlined process for applying for jobs allowing consumers to apply for more positions at an accelerated rate.<br><br>
      The program will aid Hiring Managers and Human Resource teams in corporations through utilising their systems’ AI (Artificial Intelligence) filtering to give corporations a diverse, non-biased sample of applicants that follow some basic criteria for the role.<br><br>
      The program interface will feature a system that requires the applicant users to input their skills, education, achievements, and work history in the resume section. Afterward, applicants will be assessed through several aptitude and psychological tests such as the Myers Briggs test, Typing Speed and Accuracy tests, and an array of IQ tests. Applicants may also further enhance their profile by testing themselves with additional elective tests such as excel fluency tests.<br><br>
      After the testing has been completed the user will be provided with an ‘Employee Passport’ which will include a mobile QR code. This passport will allow users to apply to employers that take advantage of Scramble and will not be required to fill out a plethora of tests supplied by other employers.<br><br>
      For small businesses, such as cafes, bars, and general stores. They will be able to take advantage of a QR Scanner that will allow people to ‘drop off’ their resume simply by scanning the QR code provided to them via the ‘Employment Passport.’ <br><br>
      On the Employer's Interface, businesses will be able to take advantage of the AI filtering system that will automatically select a diverse sample of applicants varying in gender, age, personality results, and behavioural inclinations. Businesses will be able to set minimum requirements in the filtering system with skills that are not discriminatory to ensure that they are getting candidates will have the knowledgeable skills that will allow them to complete the position being required.<br><br>  The system will also search applicants' resume sections for keywords that will score them higher in the selection process.<br><br>
      This will allow the hiring process for large businesses to be more streamlined and grant them a set of suitable interviewees much faster. Furthermore, using AI systems, will reduce the risk of unconscious bias in the hiring process resulting in a more diverse workforce and a reduction in perceived ageism, sexism, and racism by the public involving the business's operations.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2 class="section">Tools and Technologies</h2>
      To develop this system, A computer, mobile phones and QR scanners will be needed for hardware to allow for pre-release quality testing and the creation of the interface.<br><br>
      Involving software, Access to HTML related software that will allow the development of the interfaces. Secondly, the use of Python will allow the development of the interfaces internal AI.<br><br>
      Involving the development of the mobile. software it will require the use of native mobile developing software as cross-platform wont specifically be necessary.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2 class="section">Skills Required</h2>
      To develop this product several skills will be required to complete a sound product that is functional and easy to use. For example. For development of the phone application an improvement in native mobile developing will be required.<br><br>
      Secondly, for the development of the computer interface it will be a prerequisite to have sounds knowledge in several different programming languages such as HTML, Python and C++. These programming languages will also be used in the development of the filtering AI that will be embedded in the interface.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2 class="section">Outcome</h2>
      In Summary, the development of this program will streamline HR and Hiring Offices procedures and operations allowing for greater business performance and productivity.
