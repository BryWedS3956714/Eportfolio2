      The Role of a Software Engineer is a diverse role within a corporation but focuses on the development and optimization of software and computing systems in a business. The salary of a Software Engineer can vary depending on the responsibilities they are assigned. The duties of a Software Engineer are heavily focused on ‘back of house’ IT work such as coding and script work.<br><br>
      I drew great interest in the role of Software Engineer due to its creative aspect as well as its involvement in IT Languages and Coding — which happens to be my favourite type of work. I am passionate about effectively streamlining processes in a business environment. I am convinced that this role coincides with my passions and will allow me to work at my full potential.<br><br>
      A Software Engineer requires a solid understanding of a plethora of IT languages as well as the ability to effectively work in a team. This is because it is essential in this occupation to work alongside colleagues to create optimised system processes within a business as well as develop new code that will assist in making decisions on the business processes.<br><br>
      My general understanding of IT languages is poor in comparison to the requirements needed to fill the role of a Software Engineer. I need to vastly improve in those areas for my skills and qualifications to match the demands of a Software Engineer.<br><br>
      The first step to honing skills is always through education and application. Because of this, I intend to sharpen my knowledge through my studies at RMIT as well as looking for opportunities to get involved with technical projects in a range of places such as school, my workplace, and volunteer projects.<br><br>
